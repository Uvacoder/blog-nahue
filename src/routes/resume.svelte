            A brief summary of my professional life.
        </p>

        <p class="text-sm leading-5 text-gray-500 mt-5">
            For the last 6 years i worked mainly on remote positions, so i can
            say i'm able to balance my personal and work life. Before that i
            worked for the local goverment in the IT department. I started
            repairing computers as a teenager, and after a few years i reached a
            Director position, so i ended up in charge of an entire Datacenter
            keeping Personal and Financial info, as well as Services for the
            other public workers such as Websites, Email, File Servers, User
            Directory, CRM and Project Management platforms...
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm leading-5 text-gray-500 mt-5">
            But i feel that's not as important as my "newly" remote life, so
            let's get to it.
